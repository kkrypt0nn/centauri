> **Warning** Due to my military service from **July 2023** until **April 2024** I will not be able to work on this project a lot, most likely only during weekends if I have time and motivation ^-^

> **Note** This is a WIP library that may be **very unstable** and eventually **not fully optimised**, use at your own care! This README will also be reworked.
