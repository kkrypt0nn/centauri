A Discord API wrapper written in Go with the goal of being easily understandable and simple to use, even for newcomers.

## Features

The plan for Centauri would be for it to cover Discord's APIs in their entirety. A small list of features that will be,
or are already in Centauri are:

- ANSI Colors
- Background Tasks
- Caching
- Easy Commands Creation
- Gateway API
- Interactions (Buttons, Modals, etc.)
- OAuth 2.0
- Rate Limiter
- REST API
- RPC
- Sharding
- Webhooks

## Getting Started

### Installation

To get started you will simply need to install the library in your project by executing the following command.

```bash
go get github.com/kkrypt0nn/centauri
```

### Example Usage

#### REST Client

If you just want to interact with the REST API, you may use the following code.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"

	"github.com/kkrypt0nn/centauri"
)

func main() {
	botClient := centauri.NewRestClient("Bot BOT_TOKEN")
	bot, err := botClient.GetCurrentUser()
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println("err:", err)
	} else {
		fmt.Println(fmt.Sprintf("Got bot %s with ID %d", bot.Username, bot.ID))
	}
}
```
