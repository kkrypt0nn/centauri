# Intents Calculator

To get gateway events you will need to provide a value to the `GatewayClient` so that it can subscribe to the set of events. You may get more information about these in our guide and the [Discord documentation](https://discord.com/developers/docs/topics/gateway#gateway-intents).

Below you can choose the intents or events you will need, and it will give the intent value to pass.

  <i>
    Intents marked in{" "}
    <span className="intent-privileged__label">red and bold</span> are
    privileged intents, or events related to these intents, that need to be
    enabled in the developer portal. Events in{" "}
    <span className="event-default__label">blue and bold</span> are default
    events that do not require any intents and will always be dispatched.
