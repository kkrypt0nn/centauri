# Intents Calculator

To get gateway events you will need to provide a value to the `GatewayClient` so that it can subscribe to the set of events. You may get more information about these in our guide and the [Discord documentation](https://discord.com/developers/docs/topics/gateway#gateway-intents).

Below you can choose the intents you will need, and it will give the intent value to pass.

  <i>
    Intents marked in <span class="intent-privileged__label">red and bold</span>{" "}
    are privileged intents that need to be enabled in the developer portal.
